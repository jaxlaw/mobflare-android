Mobflare lets you create your own flash mob, literally,
by coordinating camera flashes across an arbitrary

To use Mobflare, one person starts by
defining the flare, including information
such as how many other people are going
to participate.  Once the new flare has
been created, others nearby can join
it.  Once everyone has joined, a countdown
is initiated, and then all of the cameras
involved will flash simultaneously.
The flare creator can choose to make
the flashes repeat and/or ripple
through the crowd.

If you do not see a newly created flare,
use the Refresh option on the menu.

This application is just for kicks;
have fun thinking of creative uses!
